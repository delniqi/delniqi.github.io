<h1>Who We Are</h1>

<p>The Guild &lt;FIVE FX&gt; and its name originates from one of the premier 5v5 arena teams in WoW history - a team that achieved the RANK 1 gladiator
  title an unprecedented 10 seasons in a row until the bracket was finally retired by blizzard.
  </p>

<p>  Adding to the original five, all of our current core members have a history of gladiator titles and, most importantly, strong PvE excellence.
  Most of us have played together for over a decade.We have both led and been a part of extremely successful raiding guilds in vanilla, TBC, and
  onward - pushing the endgame, achieving server firsts, and farming the best content available.
</p>

<p>While we have a strong core and history, we cannot progress on our own. We are looking for competent players to fill in our raid core and progress through
  all end game content. We want to raid "casually yet hardcore enough" to clear all content in 6 hours total (2 raids x 3 hours per week).
</p>

<p>  Our guild has a chill atmosphere and we love to joke around and have fun, but when it comes to getting thongs done we do not have great tolerance for BS or underperformance -
  so just do your job and get some loot! With that said, we are currently looking for most classes and roles, so please join us on our next journey throughout WoW Classic!
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>We are looking for the following:</h3>

<h1>Raid Logistics</h1>
  <br><b>Raid Times:</b> Tues/Weds 7pm-10pm PST
  <br><b>Consumables:</b> Bring on-hand as required
  <br><b>Loot System:</b> Loot Council
  <br><b>Warcraftlogs:</b> ON!
  <br><b>Discord:</b> https://discord.gg/rxf8bHQ
<br>


</p>

<p>Our Raid Loot System is Loot Council. To be eligible to receive gear from Loot Council, you must have performed well in the raid. This does includes DPS/HPS to a degree, but
  more importantly job assignments on specific bosses, raid readiness (i.e. consumables), contributions to the guild outside of raids, and so forth.</p>

 <p>We will try to distribute loot as fairly as possible, but this system is in place so that the top performing players in the raid can get more geared and help the raids progress further and faster, which will allow other players to get geared faster as well.
 </p>

<b>How it works:</b><br>
If you would like to be a candidate for a piece of loot, you must link your current piece of gear that would be replaced in /o chat, and the officers will decide who gets the loot from there.
